   <b><u>Did use Xubuntu 18.04 with XFCE4 for 3 years without regretting it</u></b>

   As professional OpenGL ES graphics developer i needed a stable OS that i could customize to my needs.
   After trying out multiple OS ( Debian, Ubuntu, LinuxMint, Fedora ) and all the desktops 
   out there (Fluxbox,XFCE4,Mate,Cinnamon,Unity,Gnome3) i felt most comfortable with Xubuntu ( im Windows damaged ).
   I got rid of LinuxMint because it wasnt stable enough for my graphics developing. I needed not much effort to destroy 
   it entirely.
   Unity and Plasma desktops were too slow for me. Also they have very reduced information per pixel, 
   meaning they waste too much screen space for my taste<br> 
   Gnome3 is not my first choice, but i know many collegues who used it daily and it has good Wayland supports which is a
   big plus for graphics programmers<br>
   Cinnamon was the most ugly and least customizable. It didnt last long enough on my computer to determine its stability.
   I know many hardcore proggers that use awesome as desktop on a daily basis (only keyboard, much less mouse usage)<br>
   I didnt feel completely satisfied without systemtray with WLAN/Network manager, volume control and the like.
   As i said i used Windows since 3.11 and i am damaged.

   <b><u>I got rid of Microsoft C++ Compiler and Microsoft Visual Studio</u></b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td height="20px"></td></tr>
<tr><td>
As of now i dont use any microsoft compiler suite or IDE ( integrated dev environment )
to write any program for Windows anymore<br>
Instead i only use the free open source compiler suite GNU GCC with its windows derivative called
MinGW compiler. I mostly simply install QtSDK with integrated MinGW x64 7.3.1 (atleast C++17)
This way i reduced the work to manage debug and release builds atleast by factor 2,
because M$ has 2 runtimes for release (MT,MD) and 2 runtimes for debug (MTd,MDd)
In Linux GCC world there is no such thing as 2 runtimes for one build target
Then i got rid of bad Visual Studio because managing libraries is hell there<br>
You have to rely on the same bad dialog since 1998! to manage multiple ( in my case hundreds ) of 
third party libs.
If i had done that with Visual Studio i would have had already killed myself
